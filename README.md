 :memo: Understanding Superstore's Sales Data using EDA and Regression  
======================================================
  
![Sales](./images/sale.jpg)


# 1. Introduction

- With the growing demand in the market, a Superstore giant likes to have a better understanding of what factors matter to their sales and improve the forthcoming sales strategy.

- The dataset is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivek468/superstore-dataset-final) and was collected between Jan. 2014 and Jan. 2018 across 49 states in the US.

- The capstone project contains four parts: data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing, final model evaluation and selection.

# 2. Data Wrangling

- Remove outliers
- Convert 'Order Date' and 'Ship Date' to the datetime datatype
- Create 'Month' and 'Year' from 'Order Date'
- Drop less useful columns

# 3. Exploratory Data Analysis  [(EDA)](https://github.com/livia360/Capstone_project2/blob/7cbf2ebc5544a27ae39cbc7a23257153c0089299/Part1_data_wrangling_and_EDA.ipynb)

**ANOVA test** 
-Use a ANOVA when you want to know how independent variables, in combination, affect a dependent variable.

**Heatmap gives us a sense of the important features to the sales**
![correlation](./images/heatmap.png)  

Important Predictors:
- Profit
- Category
- Sub-Category
- Quantity 
- Postal code (city/state/region)
- Discount 

  
![wordcloud](./images/text2.png)  
 
Through the images generated by wordcloud, we can see:

- **"xerox" and "ring binder"** are the two most important words that were repeatedly mentioned in the product names. This is not very surprising since we found out 'office supplies' has the largest volumes of orders.
- Two band names that stand out from this analysis are **"newell" and "wilson jones'**, Newell Brands is an American worldwide manufacturer of consumer and commercial products with a portfolio of brands including: Rubbermaid storage, home organization and writing instruments, etc. Wilson Jones is the inventor and supplier of the three ring binder.
- **'New York'** in the east region, **'Los Angles' and ' San Francisco'** in the west region are the top three most important cities. It makes sense because they are the cities with large amount of sales of products. 


# 4. Data Preprocessing 
  

**PCA**
- **The first two components account for about 60% of the variance, and the first five for over 85%.**

- The blue points represent the lower quartile of 'profit' and spread across the first dimension (>0).

# 5. Modeling

|Models|R2|MAE|RMSE
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
|LinearRegression|63.26|7.53|10.78
|Lasso           |63.29|7.53|10.99
|Ridge           |62.84|7.48|11.01
|RandomForestRegressor|82.96|4.02|7.28

- The results show that the best performances in terms of R squared (R²) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) correspond to random forest Regressor.
- According to the result of R² and Root Mean Squared of these 4 models, the relationship between the features and the target variable is not clearly linear and shows the presence of non-linearity in the data.
 

# 6. Summary

- Since the data was collected from the year 2014 to 2018, this model might not fully reflect all the price changes recently in the market. Moreover, features that were used in developing the models, might not be enough to sufficiently describe the sales. The sales range is mainly less than ~$100 in this dataset.

- And lastly, the market of densely populated urban areas is definitely different from that of the rural area. This means more data needs to be collected from different regions across all 49 states in the US in order to efficiently predict the sales for any particular area.
